                Chandigarh is in the list of 98 cities which are under the Smart City Project of Government of India.
                Chandigarh is among four cities which the French government has identified to invest in as part of the
                Indian government’s smart city project and has allocated as much as two billion Euros to be spent over
                the next few years

                <br> <br> <br>

                <b> Profile of “The City Beautiful – Chandigarh”: </b> <br> <br>

                Chandigarh is a city and a union territory in the northern part of India that serves as the capital of
                the states of Punjab and Haryana . As a union territory, the city is ruled directly by the Union
                Government and is not part of either state. Chandigarh and adjoining cities of Mohali (Punjab) and
                Panchkula (Haryana) are together called Chandigarh Tricity.

                <br> <br> <br>


                Chandigarh is located near the foothills of the Shivalik range of the Himalayas in northwest India. It
                covers an area of approximately 114 km2. It shares its borders with the states of Haryana and Punjab.
                The exact cartographic co-ordinates of Chandigarh are 30.74°N 76.79°E. It has an average elevation of
                321 metres (1053 ft).The city of Chandigarh was the first planned city in India post-independence in
                1947 and is known internationally for its architecture and urban design.

                <br> <br> <br>


                The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss- French architect Le Corbusier , transformed from
                earlier plans created by the Polish architect Maciej Nowicki and the American planner Albert Mayer. In
                2015, an article published by BBC named Chandigarh as one of the perfect cities of the world in terms of
                architecture, cultural growth and modernization.The roads in Chandigarh are surrounded by trees and it
                has the third highest forest cover in India at 8.51% following Lakshadweep and Goa.<br> <br> <br>

                <h2> Challenges for Chandigarh in becoming the Smart City: </h2>
<br> <br> <br>

                <b> 1. Healthcare:  </b><br><br>
                Chandigarh is the cradle of healthcare in the region, but lacks even basic infrastructure and manpower
                requirements for the city’s residents. Against a total requirement of 80 dispensaries for nearly 13 lakh
                residents, with each catering to 15,000 residents, the city has only 43.
<br> <br> <br>

                <b> 2. Education:</b> 
                <br> <br> 
                This year Chandigarh’s colleges have crossed the student enrolment figure set by the college population
                index according to which against one lakh students, one college is required.In the city’s seven
                government colleges, though well equipped, the laboratories need to be converted into virtual labs. The
                colleges have a shortage of hostel seats while students of Sector 42 and 46 colleges face a connectivity
                problem. Panjab University has been bagging the top position in international platforms, but is
                struggling for funds. It is yet to come up with smart classrooms and new hostels. Chandigarh has 107
                schools but these lack proper furniture, laboratories and space; there is a shortage of regular staff
                too, librarians have not been appointed by the Education Department, and neither do schools have regular
                counsellors. Toilets in some schools are without taps, playgrounds have restricted space with floodlight
                poles in the middle to check thefts, and sports
                are a neglected field. The student-teacher ratio is not being maintained as per the provisions of the
                RTE Act in a few schools and the students have not been issued health cards as required.
                <br> <br> <br>
           
                <b>3. Solid Waste Management:</b> 
                <br> <br>
                Chandigarh MC spends crores on purchase of garbage-lifting vehicles, bins and rehris, but has failed to
                put in place the process for collection and segregation of garbage at household level and at Sehaj Safai
                Kendras. So, garbage which can be recycled is being dumped at open spaces. Bio-medical waste management
                is also not effective in city. Chandigarh generates 370 tonnes of waste daily; 270 tonnes goes to
                garbage processing plant in Dadumajra and 100 tonnes to the dumping ground in Dadu Majra. MC has
                53-dumper placers to lift garbage from 550 garbage bins in the city, but garbage is lifted from most
                bins on alternate days. On a daily basis, MC lifts garbage from 190 bins. In some sectors, it empties
                bins once in three days, once a week and even once in 15 days.
                <br> <br> <br>
           
                <b> 4. Regulating Traffic: </b> 
                <br> <br>
                In Chandigarh, regulating the traffic is a big challenge, because of the number of vehicles — 9.75 lakh,
                while 2 lakh vehicles use city roads daily from the periphery.
                <br> <br> <br>
              
                <b> 5. Transport Service: </b> 
                <br> <br>
                Chandigarh offers only a local bus service. At present, the bus service on most routes shuts down by 9
                pm. A user-friendly bus route information system eludes the city. For many destinations, two buses have
                to be changed, but there are no route plans to guide commuters. The bus numbers are mentioned at every
                place, but not the route and the time it will take to reach its destination. Mobile-based application
                “Chandigarh bus guide” informs about the bus routes and shelters, but not about the running schedule of
                buses.
                <br> <br> <br>
           
                <h2>Conclusion </h2>
                <br> 
                In India, administration in the cities are often confronted with a multitude of key problems, like unplanned development, informal real estate markets, inevitable population growth, lack of infrastructure, inadequate transport facilities, traffic congestion, poor power supply, in competent  health services, and lack of basic  services both within the city and in the suburban areas, poor natural hazards management in overpopulated areas, crime, water, soil and air pollution leading to environmental degradation, climate change and poor  governance arrangements are leading the urban citizen life in unhappy. So it is the need of the hour to plan and build the smart cities in view of resolving these problems.

            <br>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Singapore is widely recognized as one of the most successful smart cities in the world. The city-state has implemented several innovative smart city solutions to enhance its infrastructure, sustainability, and livability. Here are some of the key smart city solutions that Singapore has implemented:

<br> <br> <br>

    <b>Smart Transportation:</b> <br> <br>
        Singapore has implemented several smart transportation solutions to reduce traffic congestion and improve mobility. The city has developed an intelligent transportation system that uses real-time data to optimize traffic flow and provide travelers with real-time information about traffic conditions. Singapore has also implemented a fleet of autonomous electric buses for public transportation, known as the Autonomous Bus Service (ABS).

        <ul >
    <li><b>Intelligent Transportation System (ITS):</b> <br>
        Singapore's ITS is a comprehensive system that uses real-time data to optimize traffic flow and provide travelers with real-time information about traffic conditions. The system includes sensors, cameras, and other technologies that monitor traffic flow and provide data to a centralized control center. The control center uses this data to adjust traffic signals, reroute vehicles, and provide real-time traffic updates to drivers.</li>
    <li><b>Autonomous Vehicles:</b> <br>
        Singapore has implemented a fleet of autonomous vehicles, including electric cars and buses, that operate on designated routes. The autonomous vehicles are equipped with sensors and cameras that allow them to navigate the streets safely and efficiently. The vehicles are also integrated with Singapore's ITS, allowing them to receive real-time traffic updates and adjust their routes accordingly.</li>
    <li><b>On-Demand Transportation:</b> <br>
        Singapore has implemented an on-demand transportation system, known as the Beeline app, that allows commuters to book shared rides on minibuses. The system uses algorithms to optimize routes and reduce waiting times, resulting in more efficient transportation and reduced congestion.</li>

        <li> <b>Electronic Road Pricing (ERP):</b>
            
Singapore's ERP is a congestion pricing system that charges drivers a fee based on the time of day and location of their travel. The system uses sensors and cameras to monitor traffic flow and adjust pricing in real-time. The ERP has been effective in reducing traffic congestion and encouraging the use of public transportation.
        </li><br>
</ul>

<br> <br> <br>

<b>Smart Energy Management:</b> <br>
Singapore has implemented a smart grid infrastructure that uses renewable energy sources like solar power to generate electricity. The city has also implemented a demand response system that allows consumers to adjust their energy usage based on real-time pricing signals, resulting in more efficient energy use and reduced energy costs.


<br> <br> <br>


<b>Smart Waste Management:</b> <br>
Singapore has implemented a smart waste management system that uses sensors to monitor waste levels in bins and optimize waste collection routes. The system has resulted in a 30% reduction in waste collection costs and a 60% increase in recycling rates.


<br> <br> <br>


<b>Smart Buildings:</b> <br>
Singapore has implemented several smart building solutions to enhance energy efficiency and occupant comfort. The city has implemented a Building Energy Management System (BEMS) that uses sensors and analytics to optimize building operations and reduce energy consumption. Singapore has also implemented a smart lighting system that adjusts lighting levels based on occupancy and daylight conditions.


<br> <br> <br>


<b>Smart Water Management:</b> <br>
Singapore has implemented several smart water management solutions to optimize water usage and reduce waste. The city has developed a Water Management System (WMS) that uses sensors and analytics to monitor water quality and usage. Singapore has also implemented a NEWater program that recycles wastewater into high-quality drinking water.


<br> <br> <br>


These smart city solutions have resulted in several benefits for Singapore's citizens, businesses, and environment. The city has reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and enhanced energy efficiency. Singapore has also improved its waste management practices and increased its recycling rates. Finally, Singapore has optimized water usage and reduced waste through its smart water management solutions.
